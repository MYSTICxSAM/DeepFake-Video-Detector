# DeepFake-Video-Detector

DeepFake-Video-Detector refers to tools or systems that identify deepfake videos, which are artificially manipulated media where someone's likeness is replaced with another's using AI, particularly deep learning techniques. These detectors analyze various aspects like facial features, audio-visual synchronization, and inconsistencies in textures or lighting to spot alterations that make it seem as though a person did or said something they never actually did. As deepfake technology evolves, these detectors play a crucial role in verifying the authenticity of videos and combating misinformation.
